# challenge-19-text-editor

## Description

This project is a text editor that meets PWA criteria and can run offline. It allows users to create code snippets without an internet connection. I learned how to use indexDB to create an object store, create a service worker, and run webpack plugins. 


## Installation

Clone or fork the repo and open the command line.  Type npm install and npm run start.

## Usage

Open the application in a web browser and click on install. After it is installed the user will be able to access code snippets without an internet connection.
